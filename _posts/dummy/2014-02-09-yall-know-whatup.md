Less than two or three months ago, I promised myself I'd use WordPress to power my personal website. Dozens of industry famous designers and developers all use the platform, so I figured it'd be fine for my own needs.<sup><a href="#note_needs">1</a></sup> I dove into theming it, familiarizing myself with its structure, logic, and specialized functions, learning a touch of <abbr>PHP</abbr> and MySQL along the way.

More often than not, however, I found my unique goals fighting with the features of the <abbr>CMS</abbr>; I wrote posts in a "Zen Coding" plug-in, recreating my own local text editing environment, I stripped all the `<div>` and `<span>` tags out and replaced them with more semantic markup, and I filled my custom WordPress theme with conditional logical that only made sense in the context of my own website. I limited myself to WordPress because *I wasn't aware of any reputable alternatives*.

After playing around with [Jekyll][%jekyll] for two weeks, now I know what I've been looking for. Jekyll gives me the ability to write my posts in Markdown or <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, freeing me up from the problematic editor in WordPress, and eliminating the need to use the proprietary back-end authoring and management tools. It's not that I hate WordPress, but for me to have almost absolute control over my site and continuously learn throughout the design process, I had to find something else.

**Jekyll is that something else.** It makes my preference of web design possible and a ton of fun to pull off. Expect future posts on how to set up the static site generator, as well as explanations of the pitfalls and headaches sure to come along with using Jekyll (because nothing is perfect).
