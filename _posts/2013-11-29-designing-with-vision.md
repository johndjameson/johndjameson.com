##Under Construction

I'm going to be honest with you: I've been designing this website for months. And by "designing," I actually mean *redesigning*. My laptop contains a graveyard of rejected `index.html` files. Each one fails in its own unique and spectacular ways, but together, they'll always remind me of an invaluable lesson I've learned along the way: establish vision before designing anything.

Simply put, vision determines the purpose and priorities of a project; without it, you can't create anything truly meaningful because you can't identify the problems you’re trying to solve or even the people you're trying to connect with. If design is thinking made visual, then vision is the catalyst for thought.<sup><a href="">1</a></sup>

Now, that might sound pretty obvious, but up until just recently, I had no idea what I really wanted to design. My entire motivation could be summarized as "Well, I bought the domain. Guess I'd better put something up." So as a result, every idea I tried out completely fell apart. Half a dozen attempts at web design became little more than derivative tech demos. I struggled to learn various tools, libraries, and best practices—hoping good design would materialize somewhere in the process. None of the resulting designs ever felt right because I couldn't explain why any of them needed to exist.


##Finding My Way

It took months for me to come to the realzation that I needed to stop toying around in the browser and get serious about discovering my vision. I did some research, read a great book, reached out to others, and gave myself no-bullshit answers to questions about the type of person I want to become. When all was said and done, I had settled on three well-defined goals:

* Explain my design process and encourage conversation
* Help others learn the things I’ve found difficult to learn elsewhere
* Make meaningful connections within the community

In even fewer words, I want to connect with and help *people*. After finally figuring that out, I was able move forward and to abandon months' worth of meaningless work. Now when making decisions about how to structure or style my website, I have documentation *that I wrote* to refer back to. Now when writing blog posts and planning future content, I have a strong vision to influence my actions and lead me in the right direction.

I know my website isn't visually stunning, but those skills will come in time as I continue to practice and grow. It's no secret that I'm still learning, and I intend 

So here are the takeaways:

* Establish vision before designing anything. It's so important, I'm saying it twice.
* Stop regularly to analyze what you're doing and if it's actually consistent with your goals and intended message. If it's not, *change what you're doing*.
* Have confidence in your decisions and be willing to learn from your mistakes. Admitting failure makes people seem more human and therefore easier to empathize with. Share those experiences. 

And with that spiel out of the way, welcome to johndjameson.com.
