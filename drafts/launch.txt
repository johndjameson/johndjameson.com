In Need of Vision

If design is thinking made visual, vision is the catalyst for thought.

Simply put, vision determines the purpose and priorities of a project; without it, you cannot create anything meaningful because you don’t know what problems you’re working toward solving or what audience you’re even trying to reach. Designers need clearly defined goals and guidelines to abide by, or it is almost impossible to create something that satisfies everyone involved.

It took me months of designing, redesigning, and re-redesigning my blog for this realization to sink in. I assumed making a personal website would be pretty straightforward. Just throw together some copy to fill the obligatory Home, About, Blog, and Contact pages, and maybe slap a hamburger menu on top of everything at the end. Simple, right?

Except that it wasn't. Lack of direction plagued every effort I made, and with each new attempt, things never managed to feel right. I expected good design to magically fall together in the browser, complete ignoring the fact that design revolves around solving problems. I couldn't be happy with the decisions I made because I honestly didn't have any explanations to justify them. I needed a plan to influence my actions—I needed a vision.


Thoughtful Reduction

"I’d love to see front end designers and developers blogging more about problems they faced and how they solved them."

— Dave Rupert

In a single sentence, Dave Rupert summarizes the refined vision behind my personal website: write about the obstacles I encounter and discuss the strategies I use to overcome them.

With that idea in mind, I began writing an outline of my goals in order to guide my decisions during the design process soon to follow. 

Here are my goals:

* Explain explain my design process and encourage others to do the same.
* Help people learn.
* Make meaningful connections in the industry.

By documenting exactly what I want to accomplish with this website and specifically whom I want to reach, I can tackle any design dilemna by asking myself, "Which of these ideas is the most consistent with my vision?"
