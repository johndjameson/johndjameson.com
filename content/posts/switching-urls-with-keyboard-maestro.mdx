As a software engineer, a common on-the-job need is quickly switching between production and development environments to compare differences. If there’s an issue in dev, I want to check prod to make sure it’s not affecting customers. If the issue’s in prod, I want to check dev to reproduce the issue locally and start fixing it.

I’ve been learning how to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) lately thanks to its performance-centric [server islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-islands/) architecture. Right now, one of the biggest Astro repositories available to the public is the [Cloudflare documentation website](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs). I have a few improvements I’d like to contribute to their codebase and part of my workflow has involved switching between development and production to compare changes — a common need for front-end engineers.

Using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/), switching environments has been as quick as a single <KeyboardShortcut>Ctrl+E</KeyboardShortcut> keyboard shortcut to toggle environment URLs.

One press and I’m able to switch between production, development, and then back with another keypress.

## Keyboard Maestro

So what is Keyboard Maestro? Keyboard Maestro is a macOS productivity and automation app that allows you to design multi-application workflows with a completely visual interface. I was introduced to Keyboard Maestro thanks to [Drew Barontini](https://drewbarontini.com/) and it’s been an invaluable part of my development workflow over the past decade.

Keyboard Maestro can do everything. It can write dynamic snippets like fake email addresses for testing; it can manage your windows by focusing certain apps and moving them; it can intercept keyboard shortcuts so <KeyboardShortcut>⌘+R</KeyboardShortcut> refreshes Chrome instead of your code editor; it can really do anything and everything.

For the scope of this post, we’re going to create a new macro to swap the active URL in Google Chrome.

## Creating a new macro

The macro works by capturing the current URL in Chrome, then using a switch statement to detect which environment we're in currently and replace it with the alternate environment. Here's how the logic works:

1. **Store the current URL in a variable**: Chrome's current URL gets stored in a variable called `TheURL`.
2. **Switch logic**: A switch statement checks the URL and replaces current URL with the alternate environment.
3. **Navigate to new URL**: Keyboard Maestro pastes the modified URL back in Chrome's address bar and simulates pressing <KeyboardShortcut>Return</KeyboardShortcut>.

So all together, the macro captures the current Chrome URL, hot swaps between production and development, then navigates to the new URL.

![Keyboard Maestro macro sets TheURL variable to equal ChromeURL, then uses a Switch block to replace the current environment string with the intended environment string. Then it sets ChromeURL and presses Return](https://jdj.land/keyboard-maestro-toggle-environments.png)

## Importing a macro

Clicking through things in Keyboard Maestro can be a little tedious, so here is the [Keyboard Maestro macro](https://jdj.land/toggle-environment.kmmacros) to toggle environments for you to import into your own Keyboard Maestro setup.

```shell
curl -o toggle-environment.kmmacros https://jdj.land/toggle-environment.kmmacros
```

To import the macro, you can select the following from the macOS menu bar while Keyboard Maestro is active:

`File > Import > Import Macros Safely…`

Select the downloaded `toggle-environment.kmmacros` macro and it will be auto imported into your active Keyboard Maestro library. For security reasons, macros are imported disabled by default. Enable the `Toggle Environments` macro, customize it to your project, and you should be good to go.

## Wrap-up

And that's it!

Keyboard Maestro is the most valuable tools I've purchased throughout my career as a software engineer. Small automations compound into huge workflow improvements, especially when chained together used multiple times day.
