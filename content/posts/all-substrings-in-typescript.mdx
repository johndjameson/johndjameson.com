Sometimes you need to find every possible substring within a string. Maybe you’re working on a pattern matching algorithm, analyzing text for word segmentation, or just practicing for coding interviews — like me.

Whatever the reason, here are a couple short approaches to solve the problem with minimal logic.

## The iterative approach

The way my brain works, I approach this as classic “2 pointers” problem that relies on iteration with nested `for` loops.

All together, that comes out like this:

```typescript
function getAllSubstrings(inputString: string): string[] {
  const substrings: string[] = [];

  for (let startIndex = 0; startIndex < inputString.length; startIndex++) {
    for (let endIndex = startIndex + 1; endIndex <= inputString.length; endIndex++) {
      substrings.push(inputString.slice(startIndex, endIndex));
    }
  }

  return substrings;
}
```

This uses 2 nested loops:
- The outer loop (`startIndex`) marks where each substring begins
- The inner loop (`endIndex`) marks where each substring ends
- For each combination, we slice the string and add it to our results

### Example output

```typescript
getAllSubstrings("abc");
// ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]
```

## The recursive approach

If you prefer recursion, here’s a solution that builds substrings by progressively removing the first character:

```typescript
function getAllSubstringsRecursive(inputString: string): string[] {
  if (inputString.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  const substringsStartingHere: string[] = [];

  for (let endIndex = 1; endIndex <= inputString.length; endIndex++) {
    substringsStartingHere.push(inputString.slice(0, endIndex));
  }

  const remainingSubstrings = getAllSubstringsRecursive(inputString.slice(1));

  return [...substringsStartingHere, ...remainingSubstrings];
}
```

How it works:
1. Base case: if the string is empty, return an empty array
2. Generate all substrings starting at the current position (from first character to end)
3. Recursively get substrings from the rest of the string (excluding first character)
4. Combine both sets of substrings

## So which one?

For most cases, **use the iterative approach**:

- It’s conceptually easier to understand if you aren’t comfortable with recursion
- No risk of stack overflow on long strings

The recursive version is worth knowing for interviews where you’re asked to solve problems recursively, but the iterative solution is more practical.

## Unique substrings only

If you want to remove duplicates in a string with repeated characters, store everything in a `Set` and convert it to an array

```typescript
function getUniqueSubstrings(inputString: string): string[] {
  const uniqueSubstrings = new Set<string>();

  for (let startIndex = 0; startIndex < inputString.length; startIndex++) {
    for (let endIndex = startIndex + 1; endIndex <= inputString.length; endIndex++) {
      uniqueSubstrings.add(inputString.slice(startIndex, endIndex));
    }
  }

  return Array.from(uniqueSubstrings);
}
```

For the string `"aab"`, this returns `["a", "aa", "aab", "ab", "b"]` instead of `["a", "aa", "aab", "a", "ab", "b"]`.

## Better luck next time

So that’s it: 2 different approaches for finding all a string’s substrings in TypeScript. The iterative 2-pointer solution is fast and practical, while the recursive version shows a different way of thinking about the problem (or if you just like recursion).

So if you ever need to know how to get all the substrings in a string, I guess now you do. Hope it comes in handy.
