The `<feTurbulence>` SVG filter is your gateway to creating organic, natural-looking textures directly in the browser. Unlike geometric patterns or gradients, turbulence generates pseudo-random noise that mimics the chaotic beauty found in nature - think clouds, fire, water ripples, or marble textures.

<TurbulenceDemo />

At its core, `<feTurbulence>` uses **Perlin noise** - a mathematical function that creates smooth, natural-looking randomness. It's the same algorithm used in procedural graphics for decades, from early computer graphics to modern game engines.

## How it works

The `<feTurbulence>` filter generates noise patterns based on several key attributes:

1. **baseFrequency** - Controls the scale of the noise (how "zoomed in" it appears)
2. **numOctaves** - Adds layers of detail at different scales
3. **type** - Chooses between "fractalNoise" and "turbulence" algorithms
4. **seed** - Sets the random starting point for reproducible patterns

Here's the basic markup:

```svg
<svg>
  <defs>
    <filter id="noise-texture">
      <feTurbulence
        baseFrequency="0.1"
        numOctaves="3"
        type="fractalNoise"
        seed="2"
        result="noise"
      />
      <feColorMatrix
        in="noise"
        type="saturate"
        values="0"
        result="grayscaleNoise"
      />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>
```

Apply it with CSS:

```css
.noise-texture {
  filter: url('#noise-texture');
}
```

## Understanding baseFrequency

The `baseFrequency` attribute controls the scale of your noise pattern. Think of it like a zoom level:

- **Low values (0.01-0.1)** - Large, broad patterns like clouds or marble
- **Medium values (0.1-0.5)** - Medium-scale textures like wood grain
- **High values (0.5-2.0)** - Fine, detailed noise like sand or fabric

You can also specify different frequencies for X and Y axes: `baseFrequency="0.1 0.3"` creates stretched or compressed patterns.

## Adding detail with numOctaves

The `numOctaves` attribute layers multiple noise patterns at different scales, creating more natural-looking complexity:

<OctavesDemo />

Each octave adds detail at half the frequency of the previous one. More octaves mean more computational cost, so stick to 1-4 for most use cases.

## Noise types: fractalNoise vs turbulence

The `type` attribute gives you two different noise algorithms:

**fractalNoise** - Smooth, flowing patterns perfect for:
- Cloud textures
- Marble effects  
- Organic shapes
- Subtle background textures

**turbulence** - Sharp, chaotic patterns ideal for:
- Fire and explosions
- Lightning effects
- Abstract art
- High-contrast textures

## Creating textures with color

Raw `<feTurbulence>` outputs grayscale noise, but you can colorize it using `<feColorMatrix>` or `<feComponentTransfer>`:

```svg
<filter id="blue-marble">
  <feTurbulence
    baseFrequency="0.08"
    numOctaves="4"
    type="fractalNoise"
    seed="5"
    result="noise"
  />
  <feColorMatrix
    in="noise"
    type="matrix"
    values="0 0 0 0 0.2
            0 0 0 0 0.4
            0 0 0 0 0.8
            0 0 0 1 0"
    result="blueNoise"
  />
</filter>
```

## Displacement effects

One of the most powerful uses of `<feTurbulence>` is creating displacement maps with `<feDisplacementMap>`. This warps elements based on the noise pattern:

```svg
<filter id="water-ripple">
  <feTurbulence
    baseFrequency="0.02"
    numOctaves="2"
    type="fractalNoise"
    seed="1"
    result="noise"
  />
  <feDisplacementMap
    in="SourceGraphic"
    in2="noise"
    scale="10"
    xChannelSelector="R"
    yChannelSelector="G"
  />
</filter>
```

## Performance considerations

`<feTurbulence>` can be computationally expensive, especially with:
- High `baseFrequency` values
- Many `numOctaves`
- Large filtered areas

For animated or interactive elements, consider:
- Using `will-change: filter` in CSS
- Limiting to 2-3 octaves max
- Pre-generating static noise textures when possible

## React component

Here's a flexible React component for generating turbulence effects:

```tsx
interface TurbulenceFilterProps {
  baseFrequency?: number | string;
  id: string;
  numOctaves?: number;
  seed?: number;
  type?: 'fractalNoise' | 'turbulence';
}

export const TurbulenceFilter: React.FC<TurbulenceFilterProps> = ({
  baseFrequency = 0.1,
  id,
  numOctaves = 3,
  seed = 2,
  type = 'fractalNoise',
}) => (
  <svg
    aria-hidden="true"
    className="sr-only"
    height="1"
    viewBox="0 0 1 1"
    width="1"
  >
    <defs>
      <filter id={id}>
        <feTurbulence
          baseFrequency={baseFrequency}
          numOctaves={numOctaves}
          type={type}
          seed={seed}
          result="turbulence"
        />
        <feColorMatrix
          in="turbulence"
          type="saturate"
          values="0"
        />
      </filter>
    </defs>
  </svg>
);
```

## Wrap up

`<feTurbulence>` opens up a world of organic, natural textures that would be impossible to create with CSS alone. Whether you're building subtle background textures or dramatic visual effects, this filter primitive gives you the power of procedural generation right in the browser.

Experiment with different frequency and octave combinations to discover your own unique textures. The possibilities are literally infinite - each seed value generates a completely different pattern.
