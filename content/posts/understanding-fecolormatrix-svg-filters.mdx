title: Understanding feColorMatrix SVG Filters

description: Like all SVG filters, <feColorMatrix> is extremely powerful and super weird to learn the first time. I’m bad at explaining, so here’s a bunch of interactive demos that hopefully help it all makes sense.

In my last post about [chromatic aberration with SVG filters](/posts/chromatic-aberration-with-svg-filters), I showed how to create an SVG/CSS-only effect that used `<feColorMatrix>` to isolate RGB color channels. Honestly, `<feColorMatrix>` is pretty complicated and deserves a whole own post on its own.

For those wondering, SVG **filter effects** are filter elements that make up the resulting effect. That’s where the `fe` prefix comes from on SVG tags like `<feTile>` and `<feMerge>`.

With `<feColorMatrix>`, you can make photo-editor style color effects:

## Matrix values

The hardest part of using `<feColorMatrix>` is learning how to use the `matrix` attribute. In the following “default” matrix, the effect will output exactly the same colors as its input:

```
1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
```

From top to bottom, rows in the matrix control a color channel from the target element:

1. Red
2. Green
3. Blue
4. Alpha (transparency)

From left to right, columns of each row represent:

1. Red × channel color
2. Green × channel color
3. Glue × channel color
4. Alpha (transparency) × channel color
5. Offset (add or subtract a predetermined constant)

So in the red row of the matrix, a value of `1 0 0 0 0` will keep the amount of red exactly the same. Lower value, less color; higher value, more color. The same goes for each channel row of the RGBA matrix: `0 1 0 0 0` for default green, `0 0 1 0 0` for default blue, and `0 0 0 1 0` for default alpha.

But what happens when you change other values? With 20 total color values to control the output RGBA channels, you can achieve a ton of different color effects. Try it out:

<ColorMatrixControls />

Changing each value in the matrix gives you a ton of control over the output of the effected element. You can create almost any color effect with these controls and `<feColorMatrix>`.

## Shorthand types

Up until now we’ve been using `<feColorMatrix>` with the type `matrix`, but there are a few others as well that are _much_ easier to use with fewer values to keep track of.

### Saturate

The type `saturate` lets you adjust color intensity with a single `values` attribute. Lower values become more black and white while higher values become super vibrant.

### Hue rotate

Like `saturate`, the type `hueRotate` uses a single `values` attribute. `0°` is your starting point and `360°` equals back where you started. Anywhere in between is similar to shifting the `hue` value of an `hsl()` color.

### Luminance to alpha

The last type is `luminanceToAlpha`, which converts all the luminance (basically brightness) in an element to transparency.

## Usage

To use any of the `<feColorMatrix>` filter effects, you need to put the SVG markup in your HTML somewhere.

```svg
<svg>
  <defs>
    <filter id="color-matrix-filter">
      <feColorMatrix type="luminanceToAlpha" />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>
```

Then you can reference the `id` in CSS.

```css
.color-matrix-filter {
  filter: url('#color-matrix-effect');
}
```

One last thing: SVG filters can thrash your computer’s hardware if not used sparingly, so take care to add `will-change: filter` on anything you’re planning to transition or animate. I’d also recommend `content-visibility: auto` if you know the element will be offscreen at some point.

## All Done

`<feColorMatrix>` can replace many of the vanilla CSS `filter` effects and is _way_ more powerful once you understand how it works. You can use apply small color corrections or entire mood shifts onto any element in the HTML/SVG DOM.

Experiment with different values to see how they affect the final result, and maybe even try chaining multiple `<feColorMatrix>` tags to compose hybrid looks.
