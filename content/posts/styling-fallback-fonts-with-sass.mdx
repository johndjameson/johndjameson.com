title: Styling Fallback Fonts with Sass

description: One of the pain points of loading fonts asynchronously is writing convoluted CSS for fallback styles. Fortunately, Sass can make it easier to achieve great-looking web typography before a site’s fonts finish loading.

If you’ve ever read a blog post about loading web fonts asynchronously for performance, you’ve probably encountered CSS like this before:

```css
html {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
}

html.wf-active {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", sans-serif;
}
```

Look familiar? In that example, I’m using the [Web Font Loader][web-font-loader] to load Source Sans Pro via JavaScript. When the fonts finish downloading, the library adds a `wf-active` class to the `html` element. Then the font family switches from Arial to Source Sans Pro — or from _fallback font_ to _web font_.

Unfortunately, most web fonts don’t have ideal system font equivalents. To soften the janky reflow when switching fonts, you’ll need to fine-tune the fallback family’s size and other properties.

Arial is bigger than Source Sans Pro, so in this example, I reduced its font size to `20px` to match Source Sans Pro at `21px`. To compensate for the decrease in font size, I also _increased_ Arial’s line height.

```css
html {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
  line-height: 1.45;
}

html.wf-active {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 21px;
  line-height: 1.35;
}
```

Here, I wrote two selectors: `html` and `html.wf-active`. It’s a pretty intuitive for properties inherited from the `html` element, but relying on a similar approach elsewhere will introduce a couple maintenance problems throughout the CSS.

Let’s go over the issues one by one and I’ll show you ways to use Sass to clean things up.

## Nest with the Ampersand Selector

The first thing we can do is use Sass’ ampersand selector to nest the current selector within an ancestor. It’s easier explain with an example:

```scss
h1 {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 34px;
  line-height: 1.25;

  html.wf-active & {
    font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", sans-serif;
    font-size: 36px;
    line-height: 1.1;
  }
}
```

The compiled CSS looks like this:

```css
h1 {
  /* Fallback styles */
}

html.wf-active h1 {
  /* Web font styles */
}
```

See how the `h1` comes after `html.wf-active`? Nesting this way cuts down on a little repetition, but there’s a lot more we can do.

## Decrease Specificity

`html.wf-active h1` is a _compound selector_, which makes it difficult to override any of its styles later on in the style sheet. Its specificity is unreasonably high for what should be a base style.

We can address that problem by flipping the selector so it affects specificity only when web fonts _haven’t_ loaded. The `not()` pseudo-class lets us do exactly that.

```scss
h1 {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", serif;
  font-size: 36px;
  line-height: 1.1;

  html:not(.wf-active) & {
    font-family: "Arial", serif;
    font-size: 34px;
    line-height: 1.25;
  }
}
```

Now when web fonts finish loading and the `wf-active` class gets applied, `html:not(.wf-active) h1` styles are ignored and the `h1` specificity stays nice and low.

## Put It in a Mixin

I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to write `html:not(.wf-loaded) &` for every fallback font style throughout my code. It’s easy to forget and tedious to write.

So let’s create a mixin to speed things up. The syntax for this one is simple. Name yours whatever you like, put the ampersand selector in there, and specify where the content goes.

```scss
@mixin fontless {
  html:not(.wf-active) & {
    @content;
  }
}
```

Now use that mixin to apply fallback font styles with ease.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 36px;
  line-height: 1.1;

  @include fontless {
    font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
    font-size: 34px;
    line-height: 1.25;
  }
}
```

If you want to use the same mixin on the `html` element, you’ll need to add a conditional to make sure it doesn’t nest inside itself.

```scss
@mixin fontless {
  @if is-superselector("html", &) {
    &:not(.wf-active) {
      @content;
    }
  } @else {
    html:not(.wf-active) & {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
```

And then it works on `html`. Kablamo.

```scss
html {
  font-family: "Source Sans Pro", "Arial", sans-serif;
  font-size: 21px;
  line-height: 1.35;

  @include fontless {
    font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
    font-size: 20px;
    line-height: 1.45;
  }
}
```

Okay, we’re done here. Who needs conclusions on front-end blog posts? You learned a thing — go have fun jank busting fallback fonts. Or [send me a tweet][twitter] if you liked the article or have any questions. That’s cool, too.
