I recently [wrote an article][guidelines] about the general guidelines for letterspacing type on the web. _This article_ is a follow-up and much more focused, so bear that in mind as you continue reading. I’d recommend checking out the last one if you want a quick overview of using letterspacing on the web.

Now with that out of the way, let’s jump right into the rules for letterspacing type with kerning and ligatures.

## Kerning

It’s a good practice to enable kerning in titles, headings, and other display type. These elements attract the most attention in a design, so it’s important to get their details _just right_ when typesetting.

### Tight letterspacing

The majority of kerning _decreases_ the space present between letters. By enabling kerning alone, you can often decrease the horizontal spacing in a line of type &mdash; similar to reducing letterspacing. Tight letterspacing exaggerates the need for kerning, so if you make negative adjustments to the `letter-spacing` property, you should probably enable kerning, too.

In the example above, there’s a noticeable gap between the unkerned _T_ and _o_ pair at the beginning of the word _Tomato_. It looks awkward in an otherwise tightly spaced context. Enabling kerning here tightens up the initial spacing and improves the overall look and feel of the word.

### Loose letterspacing

Kerning becomes less important as letterspacing increases, and at a certain point, it’s barely even noticeable.

If we look at the same word _Tomato_ &mdash; now set with positive letterspacing &mdash; the difference is too subtle to make an impact. Kerning becomes a nice-to-have here, instead of a necessity.

## Ligatures

Since ligatures are the combined form of two or more letters, and letterspacing adjusts the space _in between_ those letters, you end up with two typesetting techniques that are at cross-purposes. That’s not to say you shouldn’t letterspace type containing ligatures, but there are a couple considerations to keep in mind.

### Loose letterspacing

Ligatures are always a fixed width, but you can still letterspace the type surrounding them. As a result, ligatures end up looking clumped together within a word. It’s best to avoid them altogether in loosely letterspaced type.

/>

In this example, we’re much better off using the version of _liftoff_ that doesn’t contain ligatures.

### Tight letterspacing

Ligatures are often narrower than their two related characters, so they look right at home in lightly tightened type. In a very tight setting, however, ligatures can stand out as noticeably wider than other letters.

  title='Tight type where FT looks awkward as separate letters instead of a ligature'
/>

If you look closely at the _ff_ and _ft_ pairs in the second word _liftoff_, you’ll see an awkward gap between their crossbars. Enabling ligatures fixes this problem by combining the separate letters into a single glyph and merging the two crossbars into one.
