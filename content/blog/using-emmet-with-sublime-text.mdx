One of the biggest problems with hand-authoring HTML is the monotony of writing the common markup that surrounds content itself. While several templating languages exist to alleviate this issue, they introduce dependencies and abstractions that have a somewhat steep learning curve to master. Fortunately, a tool called Emmet walks the line between both manual and automated approaches&mdash;and has become one of the most useful additions to my workflow.

## What is Emmet?

> Emmet (previously known as Zen Coding) is a web-developer’s toolkit that can
> greatly improve your HTML &amp; CSS workflow you can type CSS-like expressions
> that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type
> in the abbreviation. &mdash; [Emmet Documentation][emmet-docs]

This means that by using Emmet we can:

- Type HTML and CSS using simple shortcuts
- Save time writing code
- Make life easier

Pretty useful, right? Let’s find out how to install it using Sublime Text.

## Installing plugins

Sublime Text has an amazing add-on called **Package Control** that lets you find and install virtually _any_ plug-in from within the application itself. The line of code to install Package Control changes with every release, so you’ll have to copy it directly from the [offcial website][packagecontrol-install].

Once you have the snippet for your version of Sublime, launch the program and show the Console (<kbd>&#x2318;+`</kbd> on OS X). Paste the intended code, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, then watch Package Control install itself like magic.

With Package Control installed, you can download additional plug-ins by opening the Command Palette (<kbd>Shift+&#x2318;+P</kbd> on OS X) and typing “Install Package” and then submitting the top result. A similar menu opens next, revealing the list of packages available for installation. Type "Emmet" here and choose the top result.

## Using Emmet

Now that we have Emmet installed, we can finally start having fun with some of its incredible shortcuts. The formula for using Emmet is very straightforward:

1. Type a supported shortcut
2. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd>

And that’s it! Check out some of the most useful [shortcuts][emmet-shortcuts] you can start using right now.

## Getting better

If you’re like me, getting up to speed with new tools is an endless struggle. Fortunately, Emmet is _completely optional_ once installed and you can ignore all of its features until **you** want to use them. This makes mastering Emmet as flexible as gradually adding shortcuts to your workflow when you need them. Start with the shorthand for a class or ID, for example, and then build up from there, learning more ambitious shortcuts along the way.

You can visit the [official documentation][emmet-docs] to discover _all_ of Emmet’s features, or if that isn’t your cup of tea, CSS-Tricks’ Chris Coyier has a sweet [screencast][csstricks-emmet-screencast] covering the basics along with everything else you’ll need to know.
