        Are you available for hire?
        ---------------------------

        Nope, I'm keeping busy day to day over at ye olde
        #{ link_to 'Code School', data.links.codeschool }.

        Is it true I can talk to you on Twitter?
        ----------------------------------------

        You bet &mdash; I'm #{ link_to '@johndjameson', data.links.twitter }
        over there. If you have feedback on an article or suggestions for a
        future topic, Twitter's the best place to start a conversation with me.

        How many Star Wars audiobooks do you own?
        -----------------------------------------

        Five so far, and they're all on Sith Lords. It feels strange getting
        back into Star&nbsp;Wars after the whole prequel fiasco, but listening
        to the audiobooks has been _a lot_ of fun.

        Nobody really asked these questions, did they?
        ----------------------------------------------

        Hey, I remember you &mdash; you're the one who spoiled Santa Claus for
        Marielle Molina in the 2nd grade!

        Anything else I should know about you?
        --------------------------------------

        I bought a lenticular poster of a bald eagle to hang on my bedroom
        wall. It is, without a doubt, the _coolest thing_ I have ever owned.
        Shout-out to kitschy museum gift shops.
