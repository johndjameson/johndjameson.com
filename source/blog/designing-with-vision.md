I'm going to be honest with you: I've been designing this website for months. And by "designing," I really mean _redesigning_. My laptop contains a graveyard of rejected `index.html` files. Each failed attempt shines in its own unique and spectacular ways, but together they'll always remind me of an invaluable lesson:

**Always determine your vision before working on a project**.

Simply put, a vision specifies the purpose and priorities of a project; without it, you can't create anything truly meaningful because you can't identify the problems you’re trying to solve or even the people you're trying to connect with. If design is thinking made visual, then vision is the catalyst for thought.[^1]

Now, that might sound pretty obvious, but up until just recently, I had no idea what I really wanted to design. My entire motivation could be summarized as "Well, I bought the domain. Guess I'd better put something up." As a result, every idea I tried out completely fell apart. Half a dozen attempts at web design became little more than derivative tech demos. I struggled to learn various tools, libraries, and best practices—hoping effective design would reveal itself somewhere during the process. But in reality, none of the resulting designs ever felt right because I couldn't explain _why_ any of them needed to exist.

Finding My Way
--------------

After months of aimlessly toying around in the browser, I eventually realized I wasn't going to get anywhere without a clear vision to guide the way. I had to stop what I was doing, organize my ideas and ambitions, and force myself to give no-bullshit answers when writing up a plan. It wasn't easy or even straightforward, but when all was said and done, I had settled on three well-defined goals.

### Goals

- Explain my design process and encourage conversation
- Help others learn the things I’ve found difficult to learn elsewhere
- Make meaningful connections within the community

In even fewer words, I want to connect with and help _people_. After finally figuring that out, I was able move forward and abandon the months of directionless work I had accumulated. Now when faced with decisions about how to lay out or style my website, I have documentation _that I wrote_ ready to refer back to. I can look at my goals, empathize with my audience, and really start making informed design decisions I believe in. This is big news and exactly the sort of thing I've internally _wanted_ to do all along—I just didn't know how to get here before.

Now look, I might not be a particularly talented designer or developer, but I'm confident that I can do everything it takes to become one. Learning new skills is always a struggle and finishing this website has been the hardest one yet. But as I continue to practice and make valuable insights, I'll finally have a place to share them with other people. I'm pretty happy with this website; there isn't a single aspect I can't give a thoughtful explanation for, and that's an _amazing_ feeling to have.

Takeaways
---------

- Always determine vision before working on a project. It's so important, I'm saying it twice.
- Stop regularly to analyze what you're doing and if it's actually consistent with your goals and intended message. If it's not, _change what you're doing_.
- Have confidence in your decisions and be willing to learn from your mistakes. Pretty much everyone screws up along the way, so don't be afraid to talk about those experiences.
