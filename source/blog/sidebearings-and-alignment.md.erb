Sidebearings are a necesary part of any font; along with kerning, they ensure letters look well-spaced next to one another. If you look at a single glyph from a font, its _sidebearings_ are the horizontal spaces to the left and right of the letterform. These, along with the character itself, span a glyph's entire width.

So how can sidebearings cause problems with alignment?

In left-aligned type, each line's first glyph begins at the same point, but because of their sidebearings, the characters don't. Characters in a text block appear farther inward than the element containing them. This causes large type to look indented when set directly above or below smaller type

<%= partial 'shared/codepen', locals: { pen: '43118a0bceea2de380f87402ff75f3c8', height: 630 } %>

As the example above demonstrates, the larger the font size is, the more indented the type appears.

Use a negative margin
---------------------

You can use a negative `margin-left` value to move the type to the left.

<%= partial 'shared/codepen', locals: { pen: '17300c1454dcfc16c02cc3fba9546333', height: 630 } %>

Depending on the typeface and font size, the value you'll need can be wildly different, so try out different values to find what works.
